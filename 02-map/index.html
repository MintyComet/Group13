			<button id="path1">Rachel Carson to Science Hill</button>
			<p> God forbid you ever need to walk from one of the bottom-most dorm colleges to Science Hill on the regular. But due to my experiences in my Freshman year, I can say that aside from some ravine paths that require a bit of hiking, this is the most
			efficient route there is.</p>

			<button id="path2">The "Center Campus" path</button>
			<p> This path is one that is probably one of the most common, the diagonal cross-section of campus from the Cowell area to Porter/Rachel Carson. It gets you to most class sections that are in Mchenry, Cowell/Stevenson and Porter/RC. </p>

		<button id="path3">Social Sciences to Mchenry</button>
		<p>Getting from College 9/10 down to Mchenry can be confusing as there is a myriad of smaller side paths to go down, but out of all of them, skirting the Natural Sciences is the most efficent way. After taking the bridge, its a pretty
		simple downhill walk from there along the side paths pictured to get to Mchenry.</p>
